                  Japanese Doitsu Koi is known for its distinctive beauty and
                  unique shape with few or no scales. To evaluate a quality
                  Doitsu koi fish, breeders usually pay attention to these shape
                  characteristics:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The shape of the Doitsu koi must have balance and harmony.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The fish body should be slim and long, creating a harmonious
                    and regular feeling from front to back.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The back of the Doitsu koi needs to be flat and wide,
                    creating a foundation for the development of rare large
                    scales.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The tail should be large and fully developed, with a flat
                    bottom and smoothly curved top.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>

                  The criteria for evaluating quality and healthy Doitsu koi
                  fish are also determined through their swimming style:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Doitsu Koi's swimming form should show grace and power, with
                    a perfect balance between the body parts.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The fish should move flexibly and energetically in the
                    water, showing precision in every movement.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Doitsu Koi's swimming form should be even and smooth,
                    without unnecessary jerking or shaking.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In particular, the head should be raised slightly higher
                    than the body to create a harmonious balance.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                  Japanese Doitsu Koi is one of the koi lines admired for its
                  unique beauty, mainly based on its outstanding colors:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The characteristic of beautiful Doitsu koi is that the back
                    has no coloration phenomenon, with transparent blue scales
                    from head to tail.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The distinct division of the body into two colors, with a
                    white head and back, is a special highlight of this fish.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The head and underside of Doitsu Koi are often orange-red,
                    red or orange-yellow in colour, creating a striking contrast
                    to the rest of the fish's body.

                When choosing to buy Doitsu koi fish, one of the most popular
                koi fish because of its characteristic color patterns, you need
                to pay attention to the following important factors to be able
                to evaluate beautiful Doitsu koi fish:
              </p>
              <ul className="important-notes">
                <li>
                  Check the shape of the fish. The ideal Doitsu koi has a long,
                  slightly flattened and plump body, with a straight tail that
                  is not curved. The body should be blue with light blue or sky
                  blue markings that blend harmoniously with the dark blue on
                  the back.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In addition, you should pay attention to the quality of the
                  fish's color. The Doitsu's blue color should be clear, bright,
                  and free of signs of fading. The shape and color scheme of the
                  fish itself should also be harmonious and balanced, without
                  any unwanted dark spots or discoloration. In particular,
                  carefully check the belly and underside of the fish to ensure
                  there are no signs of disease or damage.
                </li>
